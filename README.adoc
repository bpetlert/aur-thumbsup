A tool to manage voting for favorite AUR packages (including systemd service for auto vote for installed packages)

== How Does Auto-Vote Works

`aur-thumbsup` will vote/unvote only for non-official installed packages.
It starts by querying all installed packages that do not exist in official repositories (`core`, `extra`, `community`, and `multilib`)
and then filter out any packages that do not exist in AUR.
Finally, vote for any packages that not yet vote and unvote any packages that are not installed anymore.
